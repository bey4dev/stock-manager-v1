# Sales Module - Flexible Pricing System Documentation

## Overview
The Sales module now supports a flexible pricing system with multiple discount types, customer categories, and promotional codes. This allows for different pricing strategies for different customer types.

## New Features

### 1. Customer Types
- **Regular Customer**: Standard pricing with optional discounts
- **Reseller**: Automatic 3% discount applied to all purchases
- **Wholesale**: Automatic 5% discount applied to all purchases

### 2. Discount Types
- **None**: No discount applied
- **Percentage**: Percentage-based discount (e.g., 10% off)
- **Fixed Amount**: Fixed amount discount (e.g., Rp 5,000 off)
- **Promo Code**: Special promotional discount with code

### 3. Pricing Calculation
The system calculates prices in the following order:
1. Base Price (from product)
2. Customer Type Discount (if applicable)
3. Additional Discount (percentage, fixed, or promo)
4. Final Price = Base Price - Total Discounts

### 4. New Database Fields
The Sales table now includes these additional fields:
- `customerType`: 'regular' | 'reseller' | 'wholesale'
- `discountType`: 'none' | 'percentage' | 'fixed' | 'promo'
- `discountValue`: String value for discount amount/percentage
- `promoCode`: Promotional code (if applicable)
- `finalPrice`: Final calculated price per unit
- `originalTotal`: Original total before discounts
- `savings`: Total amount saved through discounts
- `notes`: Additional notes for the sale

## Google Sheets Integration

### Updated Column Structure
The Sales sheet now uses columns A through O:
- A: ID
- B: Date
- C: Product
- D: Quantity
- E: Price (original unit price)
- F: FinalPrice (discounted unit price)
- G: Total (final total amount)
- H: Customer
- I: CustomerType
- J: DiscountType
- K: DiscountValue
- L: PromoCode
- M: OriginalTotal
- N: Savings
- O: Notes

### Setting up Google Sheets
1. Open your Google Spreadsheet
2. Navigate to the "Sales" sheet
3. **BACKUP** existing data first by duplicating the sheet
4. Select the header row (A1:O1)
5. Copy and paste the following headers:
   ```
   ID	Date	Product	Quantity	Price	FinalPrice	Total	Customer	CustomerType	DiscountType	DiscountValue	PromoCode	OriginalTotal	Savings	Notes
   ```
6. Format the header row (bold, background color)
7. Adjust column widths for readability
8. Freeze the header row (View > Freeze > 1 row)
9. The system will automatically populate these columns when sales are added

**üìã Quick Setup:** Use the `fix-sales-headers.html` file for step-by-step guidance and copy-paste headers.
